    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>This demo shows our approach to teaching full-stack Iot, from hardware to messaging to software.</p>

    <p>We augment the excellent <a href="http://thepopuppinholecompany.com/viddy">Viddy pinhole camera</a> with a cheap light sensor that tells you how long to expose your image.</p>

    <p>It's a workshop format similar to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodebot-workshop">Nodebot workshop</a>.</p>

    <h2>What you'll learn</h2>

    <img src="/media/smart-pinhole-flow.svg" />

    <p>Our demo workshop teaches the basics of <a href="http://johnny-five.io">Johnny Five</a> to connect get an Arduino to read the current light level from a cheap light sensor. You'll then find out how to publish those readings over the internet where a web app will pick them up to display.</p>

    <p>The video shows the final result.</p>

    <h2>Use familiar tools</h2>
    <p>Use the developer tools you know to learn something new. The workshop uses whichever development tools you're comfortable with so you can get started right away.</p>

    <h2>Arduino optional</h2>
    <p>You can get started even without the camera or even the Arduino. The workshop can run mock versions of the Arduino in software on your laptop.</p>
    <p>When you have the kit, you can use the same code for real.</p>
