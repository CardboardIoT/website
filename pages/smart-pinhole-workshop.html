    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>This demo shows our approach to teaching full-stack Iot, from hardware to messaging to software.</p>

    <p>We augment the excellent <a href="">Viddy pinhole camera</a> with a cheap light sensor that tells you how long to expose your image.</p>

    <p>It's a workshop format similar to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodebot-workshop">Nodebot workshop</a>.</p>

    <h2>What you'll learn</h2>

    <img src="/media/smart-pinhole-flow.svg" />


    <p>Our demo workshop teaches the basics of <a href="http://johnny-five.io">Johnny Five</a> to connect get an Arduino to read the current light level from a cheap light sensor. You'll then find out how to publish those readings over the internet where a web app will pick them up to display.</p>

    <p>The video here shows the final result.</p>

## Materials optional

You can get started even without the camera or even the Arduino. The workshop creates mock versions of everything.
